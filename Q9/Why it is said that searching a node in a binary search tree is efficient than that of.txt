BINARY TREE	
BINARY TREE is a non linear data structure where each node can have almost two child nodes
BINARY TREE is unordered hence slower in process of insertion, deletion and searching.
IN BINARY TREE there is no ordering in terms of how the nodes are arranged	


BINARY SEARCH TREE
BINARY SEARCH TREE is a node based binary tree which further has right and left subtree that too are binary search tree.
Insertion, deletion, searching of an element is faster in BINARY SEARCH TREE than BINARY TREE due to the ordered characteristics
IN BINARY SEARCH TREE the left subtree has elements less than the nodes element and the right subtree has elements greater than the nodes element.
