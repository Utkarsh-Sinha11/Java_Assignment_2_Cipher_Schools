Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget to delete it.
Memory leaks are particularly serious issues for programs like daemons and servers which by definition never terminate.

To avoid memory Leak free the memory as soon as its work is complete:\
example:

int *ptr = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int)); 
  
   /* Do some work */
  
free(ptr);
