SINGLY LINKED LIST (SLL)	vs DOUBLY LINKED LIST (DLL)

In SLL, the traversal can be done using the next node link only.	In DLL, the traversal can be done using the previous node link or the next node link.	
The SLL occupies less memory than DLL as it has only 2 fields.	The DLL occupies more memory than SLL as it has 3 fields.
Less efficient access to elements.	More efficient access to elements.

SLL has nodes with only a data field and next link field.	DLL has nodes with a data field, a previous link field and a next link field.
