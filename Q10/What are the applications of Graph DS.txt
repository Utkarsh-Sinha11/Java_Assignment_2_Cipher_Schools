1 In computer science graph theory is used for the study of algorithms like:
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Prims's Algorithm
Kruskal's Algorithm

2.Graphs are used to define the flow of computation.

3.Graphs are used to represent networks of communication.

4.Graphs are used to represent data organization.

5.Graph transformation systems work on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs. Graph databases ensure transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph structured data.

6.Graph theory is used to find shortest path in road or a network.

7.In Google Maps, various locations are represented as vertices or nodes and the roads are represented as edges and graph theory is used to find the shortest path between two nodes.
